# Derpibooru Hide Comments
Adds a toggleable button to hide comments on images. Setting is saved and remembered accross images.

## Installation
You will need a browser extension for loading userscripts. The reccommended ones are [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox, and [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) for Chrome.

To install the userscript, simply click the link below, or go to the ".user.js" files in the repository and click the "Raw" button in the top right. Your userscript extension should recognize the script and ask if you would like to install it.
